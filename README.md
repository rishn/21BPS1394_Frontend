This project is a **trademark search engine** designed to provide users with the ability to search for and view detailed information about registered trademarks. The application features a clean, user-friendly interface that displays trademark logos, names, serial numbers, and statuses with color-coded indicators for easy navigation.

This was made as part of the Trademarkia Hiring Challenge.
